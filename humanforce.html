        <h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
        <h5>
          Humanforce is a comprehensive employee management platform designed to streamline staff sign-in, attendance tracking, and
          salary monitoring for Eatup Food Services Limited. As the lead on both design and development, I was responsible for the entire process,
          from conceptualizing the platform in FigJam and Figma to implementing the front-end with React and the back-end using
          Node.js and Express.js. Humanforce provides a user-friendly and efficient way for Eatup Limited to manage their staff’s work
          hours, attendance, and payroll, all in one integrated system.
