        <h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
        <h5>
          Mola Exchange Limited is a cutting-edge currency pair trading platform designed to facilitate seamless transactions
          between various currency pairs. As the lead designer and front-end developer, I crafted an intuitive user interface that
          enhances the trading experience for users. Utilizing FigJam and Figma, I mapped out and sketched the design process to
          ensure clarity and functionality. The platform is powered by JavaScript, utilizing WebSocket technology for real-time
          data updates, along with API integration with a robust Python backend. Mola Exchange Limited aims to provide traders
          with the tools they need to make informed decisions and execute trades efficiently in a fast-paced market.
